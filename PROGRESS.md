# Progress

## Phase 0: Foundations and contracts — implemented; Docker gate item WAIVED (pending)

Built: repo skeleton; `docker-compose.yml` (db = pgvector/pgvector:pg16, api, frontend placeholder);
config (YAML + env); secret-scrubbing logging; contracts (`CanonicalEvent`, taxonomy, `GroundTruth`,
`Diagnosis`, evidence/score weights, anomaly); interfaces (`Collector`, `Detector`, `GraphStore`,
`VectorStore`, `LLMClient`, `Embedder`); 10 DB models + Alembic migration `0001`; `/health` endpoint.

Gate status:
- [x] `pytest` passes (contracts, diagnosis accept/reject, config, logging, interfaces, migration vs models, migration up/down, `/health`).
- [x] `ruff check` clean.
- [x] Schemas validate with unit tests, including diagnosis accept/reject cases.
- [x] `docker compose up --build` brings up api + db (verified 2026-10-06, Windows 11, Docker Desktop 4.93.0 / Engine 29.8.1, Compose v5.5.1; it had been waived under D17 until then):
  - `GET /health` -> 200 `{"status":"ok","database":"ok"}`; stopping `db` -> 503, restarting -> 200.
  - `alembic upgrade head` ran on PostgreSQL 16: 10 tables + `alembic_version` = `0001`; extension `vector` 0.8.7 installed.
  - Postgres schema vs SQLAlchemy models: `compare_metadata` diff is empty.
  - Frontend placeholder served on http://localhost:3000.
  - Inside the api container (Python 3.11.17, Linux): 79 tests pass; the 2 IaC-template tests error only because the image does not include `infra/` (by design).

## Phase 1: Scenario generator, offline dataset, replay collector — implemented, gate PASSED

Branch: `phase1/scenario-generator`. Details: `docs/offline-dataset.md`, `infra/README.md`.

Built:
- `app/offline/topology.py`: 4 reference topologies (ecs, lambda, ec2, sqs) with resources, dependency edges, CloudWatch metric specs and log groups.
- `app/offline/faults.py`: signatures for all 10 fault types (metric effects with lag/ramp/oscillation, logs, CloudTrail, Config, alarm, ground-truth text, resolution).
- `app/offline/simulator.py`: seeded deterministic simulator (AR(1) noise, daily cycle, 60 s / 300 s resolution, Sum vs Average scaling, missing points, collection gaps, background logs/CloudTrail/Config noise, data-driven alarm time).
- `app/offline/dataset.py`: plan of 124 cases, stratified dev/test split, two files per incident (observable vs truth), manifest with per-file sha256, `DatasetLoader` with checksum verification.
- `app/offline/replay.py`: `ReplayCollector` (implements `Collector`), plus `inventory()` and `default_request()`.
- `app/offline/generate.py`: CLI `python -m app.offline.generate`.
- `infra/test-stack/template.yaml` (CloudFormation: ALB + ECS Fargate + RDS + SQS/Lambda consumer) and `app/offline/fault_injection.py` (inject/revert all 10 faults, dry run by default). **Written, never run against AWS.**

Gate status:
- [x] >=100 cases load through `ReplayCollector` into CanonicalEvents (124 cases).
- [x] Regeneration with the same seed is byte-identical (test compares every file).
- [x] Ground truth validates against the taxonomy; every evidence id exists in the events; primary resource is in the inventory.
- [x] >=10 red-herring (12), >=5 insufficient-evidence (6), >=5 compound (6) cases.
- [x] Blinded descriptions (forbidden-word test), ground truth absent from observable files, opaque incident ids.
- [x] `pytest` 81 passed; `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` clean.

Known limits (all data is smoke-test / synthetic):
- The simulator, ground truth and later rules share one author's assumptions about how faults look (circularity risk; see BRIEF analysis). Real captures via the test stack are the mitigation.
- No scenario uses the `other` label.
- Byte-identity is verified across OSes: seed 42 gives the same `content_sha256` on Windows/Python 3.12 and Linux/Python 3.11 (D22).
- Fault-injection tool and CloudFormation template are untested against AWS.

## Next: Phase 2 (real AWS collectors)
Install the `aws` extra (`pip install -e ".[dev,aws]"`). Build boto3 collectors and a contract test proving they emit schema-identical CanonicalEvents to `ReplayCollector`.

## Team hand-off
Setup, commands and working rules are in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. CI runs ruff (lint + format check) and pytest on every PR. Branch naming: `phaseN/<topic>`.

## How to run tests
```
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q
.venv\Scripts\python -m ruff check .
.venv\Scripts\python -m ruff format --check .
```
